## Overview

This repository contains the official implementation and the CSCMG dataset for the paper: "Bridging Scales in Map Generation: A scale-aware cascaded generative mapping framework for consistent multi-scale cartographic representation".

Multi-scale tile maps are essential for geographic information services. While existing image generation networks can produce map-like outputs from remote sensing imagery, they often emphasize texture replication over preserving geospatial features, limiting cartographic validity. Current approaches face challenges in integrating cartographic generalization principles with dynamic multi-scale generation and suffer from spatial discontinuities due to tile-wise generation.

To address these limitations, we propose **SCGM**, a **S**cale-aware **C**artographic **G**enerative **M**apping framework that leverages conditional guided diffusion and a multi-scale cascade architecture. SCGM hierarchically constrains large-scale map synthesis with small-scale structural priors, effectively mitigating edge artifacts while maintaining geographic fidelity.

## Key Innovations

The SCGM framework introduces three key innovations:

1. A **scale modality encoding mechanism** to formalize map generalization relationships.
2. A **scale-driven conditional encoder** for robust feature fusion.
3. A **cascade reference mechanism** ensuring cross-scale visual consistency.

Our contributions include:

* Developing a scale-modality encoding mechanism for data-driven embedding of multi-scale cartographic knowledge priors.
* Eliminating edge discontinuities and maintaining semantic coherence across scales by using smaller scale map tiles as spatial constraints in a cascaded generation strategy.
* A dual-branch scale-adaptation network that extracts complementary features from remote sensing imagery guided by cascaded references.

## Framework Architecture

The SCGM framework employs a hierarchical, self-cascading pipeline that progressively synthesizes multi-scale tile maps by refining smaller-scale outputs under explicit scale conditioning.

The framework comprises three core modules:

* **ScaleEncoder:** Embeds scale-related spatial context.
* **MFEncoder:** Fuses semantic features from remote sensing imagery and cascading references.
* **SFAdapter:** Aligns multi-scale features with the denoising trajectory.

## CSCMG Dataset

We introduce the **C**ross-**S**cale **C**ascade **M**ap **G**eneration (CSCMG) dataset, comprising real-world remote sensing images and tile maps from Glasgow and London, UK. CSCMG pairs multi-scale tile maps (scales 1:35, 000 to 1:2, 000) with corresponding imagery and includes scale information (map scale, level, resolution, feature types).

**Dataset Details:**

* Total Pairs: 137, 042
  + Training set: 135, 571 pairs
  + Testing set: 1, 471 pairs
* Scales: 1:35, 000, 1:15, 000, 1:8, 000, 1:4, 000, 1:2, 000
